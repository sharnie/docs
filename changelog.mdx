1. **Purchase Reserved Concurrency and Scale Infinitely**: You can now reserve more concurrent calls with Vapi and scale infinitely by switching to our new top up payment system on the [billing page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/org/billing). To migrate, click "Switch to Credit Based Billing" and make a payment. Advantages include:

  - **Support More Users Without Limits**: You don't need to worry about getting throttled or staying under usage limits on the conversations you can have with Vapi.
  - **Predictable Budgets**: You know exactly how much you will spend on Vapi each month, and you can top up at any time as your needs grow.
  - **Select Add-Ons You Need**: The credit based billing page allows you to select HIPAA compliance, dedicated Slack support, and the maximum number of concurrent calls you expect.

<Warning>This will require human input to login and migrate your account. You will not be able to revert back to the old billing system.</Warning>

    1. **Call Cost Information**: You can now use `call.costs[type=vapi].subType` to determine if a VAPI cost is `normal` or an `overage`.

    2. **Updated Billing Page**: Your payments are now returned inside a table with pages on the [billing page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/org/billing).

  <Accordion title="October 7 to October 8, 2024">
    1. **New GPT-4o Model Support for Azure OpenAI**: You can now specify the `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model in the `models` field when configuring Azure OpenAI credentials. Use this model to access the latest GPT-4 operational capabilities in your applications.

    2. **Specify Timestamps as Strings in `/logs`**: We now expect timestamps as strings when working with logs. Please make sure to handle this accordingly in your applications.

  <Accordion title="October 6 to October 7, 2024">
    1. **Add Structured Outputs for OpenAI Functions in Assistant Tools**: You can use [OpenAI Structured Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) by specifying a new parameter called `strict` as true or false when creating or using `OpenAIFunction`s in `assistant.model.tools[type=function]`. Set the `name`, provide a `description` (up to 1000 characters), and specify `parameters` as a [JSON Schema object](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema). See the [OpenAI guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) for examples.

    2. **Secure Incoming SIP Phone Calls to Vapi Provided SIP Numbers**: You can now specify a `username`, `password`, and optional `realm` in SIP Invite AuthZ header, through digest authentication. Create this secure SIP number by specifying an "authentication" object with the username and password fields inside `POST /phone-number` request body. Example:
    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer {}API_KEY}}' \
    --data-raw '{
      "provider": "vapi",
      "sipUri": "sip:{{USERNAME}}@sip.vapi.ai",
      "assistantId": "{{ASSISTANT_ID}}",
      "name": "example phone number label for your reference",
      "authentication": {
        "realm": "sip.vapi.ai",
        "username": "test@example.com",
        "password": "example_password"
      }
    }'
    ```

    3. **Use Updated `handoff`, `callback` Steps in Blocks**: You can now use `assistant.model.steps[type=handoff]` and `assistant.model.steps[type=callback]` to control conversation flow in your assistant. Use `HandoffStep` to move to the next step linearly without returning to the previous step, ideal for sequential tasks like forms. Use `CallbackStep` to spawn a new conversation thread and return to the previous step once done, good for handling interruptions or sub-tasks within a conversation.

    4. **Use Step Destinations and Assignment Mutation in Blocks**: Specify destination nodes for each step with `assistant.model.steps[type=handoff].destinations[type=step]` to direct the workflow to specific steps based on certain conditions. Update context variables in each callback step with `mutations[type=assignment]`, for example: `assistant.model.steps[type=callback].mutations[type=assignment]`
